# Homework 4

### dmesg.txt
This is the regions from dmesg that is relevant to this assignment.
I decided to add my show\_mem call and my custom buddyinfo method to the beggining of rest\_info.
Therefore, the dmesg lines included are from around that area.

### FILENAME\_dddd\_DDDD.txt
These files are regions of the kernel source files I edited for this assignment.
Each file indicates which kernel source file the region is taken from, as well as the line numbers.

NOTE: All files are derived from kernel version 4.15-rc8.
