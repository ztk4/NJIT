# Homework 5

### dmesg.txt
This is the region from dmesg that is relevant to this assignment.
It includes when the hotplug threads first come up, the thread info blocks surrounding the creation
of the kernel\_threads, and some of the output of the running hotplug threads later after boot.
NOTE: Thread comm's that are mine are prefixed with `ZK: `.

### FILENAME\_dddd\_DDDD.txt
These files are regions of the kernel source files I edited for this assignment.
Each file indicates which kernel source file the region is taken from, as well as the line numbers.

NOTE: All files are derived from kernel version 4.15-rc8.
