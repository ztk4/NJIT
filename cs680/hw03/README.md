# Homework 3

The files in this directory are copies of the kernel source files I edited for this assignment.
The following is the localtion from the root of the kernel repository for each file:

- setup.c => arch/x86/kernel/setup.c
- nsfs.c => fs/nsfs.c
- core.c => kernel/sched/core.c
- isolation.c => kernel/sched/isolation.c
- security.c => security/security.c

NOTE: All files are derived from kernel version 4.15-rc8.
