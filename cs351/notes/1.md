### Why Cybersecurity

- Workforce Shortage ;)
- Cryptography has lots of award potential ;;)
- Databreaches and API abuse are pretty common news topics today
- Also Ransomware
- It's Everywhere
    - Communication
    - Computation (TPU or Homeomorphic Encrypt)
    - Finance

#### Prereq

- Theory/Crypto
- Systems/Networks

### Course Outline

1. Crypto basis
1. Computer and software security
1. Data and system security
1. Network security
1. Emerging topics

### Course Goal

** Provide broad fundamental concepts and practical applications of CyberSec **
** DO NOT HACK OTHERS ** ~~Duh, be a white hat~~

## Introduction

### Different Types of Security

- Authorization (1-way or 2-way)
- Encryption (on the wire, or for static storage)
- Consider for static storage privelage system for write/read access
    - Maybe mint/cookies?
- How do we entangle digital security with physical access to assets?


#### Banking Analogy

- ATM: Identification scheme and Access control
    - All users must authorize
    - Accounts may only be modified by authorized user with permisions
- Online Banking Portal: Confidentiality, Availability, Mutual Authorization
    - All messages must be opaque on the wire
    - Both ends must trust they are actually communicating with eachother
- Banking Ledger / DB: Authorization scheme (heirarchy)
    - Modifications are protected based on extent of access of personell
    - Modifications are recorded and justified
- Vault Access: Needs availability, but also authorization
    - Avoid single point of failure
    - Ensure access is possible at any time when needed
- Federal Reserve: Authority/Accountability to print, as well as
  certification of bank notes.
    - Either need laws to enforce accountability on single mint (The Reserve)
    - Or need decentralized system where no agent(s) can create value without
      the direct affect of loss is experienced by all agents invovled
