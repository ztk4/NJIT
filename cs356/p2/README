COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

	0. Must be run from src directory
		cd src/

	I. Load in a new version of gcc
		$ module load gcc/6.1.0

	II. (OPTIONAL) Run Unit tests (feel free to use -j)
		$ make check

	III. Build production targets (feel free to use -j)
    $ make

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

	0. Should be run from src directory
		$ cs src/

  I. Load in new version of gcc (Must be done on all machines b/c linking)
    $ module load gcc/6.1.0

  II. Run each router in any order (with config file and in verbose mode).
    $ ./router0 network.cfg -v  # Must be run on afsconnect1.njit.edu (unless changed in network.cfg)
    $ ./router1 network.cfg -v  # Must be run on afsconnect2.njit.edu (unless changed in network.cfg)
    $ ./router2 network.cfg -v  # Must be run on afsconnect3.njit.edu (unless changed in network.cfg)
    $ ./router3 network.cfg -v  # Must be run on afsconnect4.njit.edu (unless changed in network.cfg)

	III. Each router will print out it's initial table, but waits on <Enter> press from user on stdin.
    <Press Enter in each terminal>

  IV. After all the router's converge (trace printing will halt), press <Enter> to terminate. (^C works too).
    <Press Enter in each terminal>

CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS

	0. Must be run from src directory
		cd src/

	I. Cleanup
